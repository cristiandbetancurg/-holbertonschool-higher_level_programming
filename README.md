Foundations
The primary focus of Foundations is to achieve mastery of fundamental engineering concepts and become skilled in coding. Professional Development will be a key supplement of this primary goal. At the conclusion of Foundations, students will have acquired a strong foundation of technical knowledge from which they can either build upon with a Specialization or begin preparing for interviews and jobs as part of Holberton’s interview prep, Career Sprint.
